### Some points to note for others interested in starting their tech journey:

- Kubernetes can be complicated if you do not learn containers first but if you keep trying, it gets better.
- The use cases may be hard to understand for people who don’t have a tech background but you will slowly learn them by engaging with others.

### Before you start;

1. Find out what you like. Exploring different areas of tech. Go to [BreakInto](https://www.breakinto.tech) to find a non-coding path if you so choose.
2. Start an online course (like [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs)) or YouTube video to get the basic knowledge on what you want to learn
3. Join communities and learn from others - You can learn by yourself but it gets easier when you learn from others. [Learn from this guide to coffee chats](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beginners-guide-coffee-chats-networking-linkedin-rebecca-mclaren/)

### Some tips to help you start:
- There are boot camps that you can join when starting out. For example, [100 Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs) which is structured and makes it easy to follow for people starting out.
- While learning, you can employ the use of other apps to help you. For example, an app called [Anki App](https://www.ankiapp.com/) – where you can create flashcards online, and then practice using those flashcards
- You have to get out of your comfort zone to accomplish bigger things. 
- Networking with other people at conferences and events can lead to unexpected things.
- Talk to people and start conversations that will help you to get out of your confort zone.
- Reach out to people on social media and then meet them at the conferences or events for an opportunity to learn from them.
- Message event organisers to find out if there are scholarships for those who want to attend but can’t afford like in the case of [KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/attend/scholarships/).
