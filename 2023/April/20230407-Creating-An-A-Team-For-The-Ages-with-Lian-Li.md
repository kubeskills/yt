## Show Notes

1. Empathy and communication are very important for team work. Build a team of people who know how to communicate, and have empathy when leading a team.
2. When you share the same values, it’s easy to trust your team mates. Find people that have shared values to work with and be intentional about creating trust with them.
3. Acknowledge people’s  work/ contribution to make them feel like they are a part of something bigger.
4. A great team needs to have a diversity of people. Diversity in a team provides an array of different opinions hence a higher chance for success.
5. Invest more into things that are not subject to hype cycles of technology. This gives you an upper hand in your career.
6. Talking to people and being able to work with people, even difficult people, is a human skill that will always be needed in any kind of industry.
7. Anyone can work on a team depending on the process of team building. Teams are immutable; whenever someone leaves the team, another joins in and should be able to go through the team building process. 
8. Do away with assumptions about people; be open minded to allow your team to thrive. Utilise each person’s strength to build a strong team.
9. Figure out who you are because you change every so often and you will need to know how to apply yourself to other people and situations. This will help you to also thrive in a team.
10. Have range, do not confine yourself to one skill; learn what you can and what other tools you can use.
11. Have both technical and creative people on your team to bring different perspectives into your work.
12. As a manager, you have to learn to focus on the person because they have value beyond their work. They are not of value just because they are a hard worker or a high performer, but simply because they are a person.
