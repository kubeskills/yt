- New features coming to OpenSauced
- If you are looking to get hired, contribute to projects that the company hosts
- Don't do the lowest level of contributions like finding a single typo
- Reach out in IRC or Slack to see what people are talking about and ask questions
- Try to be reasonable when contributing and treat people like humans
