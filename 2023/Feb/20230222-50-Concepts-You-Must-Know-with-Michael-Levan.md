## NOTES

- This book is supposed to be used as a reference guide
- This book is not meant for beginners to Kubernetes
- This book is meant to provide a starting place for diving deeper into other topics, with references to other books included.
- The book is split up between Day 0 (planning), Day 1 (implementation), and Day 2 (securing, monitoring and observing)
- It's important to remember how you'll be approaching these concepts on the job. Reverse engineering sometimes comes in handy for solving a specific task.
- Iptables (used with kube-proxy) don't scale well, and for larger environments, ebpf is a better solution. 
- Pre-requisties to learning Kubernetes include Linux, Linux networking, infrastructure and container runtimes. Suggested resources are the books for network + (CompTIA), and Professor Messor.
